        Let me begin by expressing my profound thanks to the members of Congress who have pursued
        fairness in the

        I thank the millions of Americans who have fought to make America great again,
        who voted for me, and who have supported my family and what we stand for.

        Now, I know a lot of you are disappointed with how everything turned out. I've
        built one of the best administrations ever seen: ever. And, let me tell you,
        we got stuff done. We put America First, and we're going to keep putting America
        First.
        </p>
      </div>

      <p class='measure-wide lh-copy'>
      And for all of you who are out of work, who have gotten a raw deal
      in the last eight years, I wanted to build America like I've built
      wonderful, huge businesses from the ground up. My success in the real
      estate and investments is where I learned how to win, and we should win.

        But now they're saying that it was too much: that I can't have a successful
        business and also save this country. Sadly, in discussions with many
        leaders, I've decided that with the Emolument Clause matter I no longer have
        the support of Congress.

        <p class='measure-wide lh-copy reason reason-russia'>
        But unfortunately, there are many in our government who have
        been against me - against us, from the very beginning. Trust me,
        I know how to create deals, and since the second I started being
        president, the press has been very unfair to me. I say and I will continue
        to say that Russia is a strong ally and that America needs to 
        be America first.

        So today I'm passing the power of the United States Presidency to Mr. Mike Pence,
        my first pick for Vice President and an incredibly great leader. A great man.
        Trust me, he knows how to fix this country, and there's no one better to do it.

        It has been my honor to lead this country, and starting this movement. It's going
