# trump.mistakes

A Trump Impeachment speech generator. Because he should be impeached, and will give a speech. Here's [Nixon's resignation speech for example](http://www.pbs.org/newshour/spc/character/links/nixon_speech.html).

It's simple: a single index.html page, which shows and hides choose-your-own-adventure style bits by CSS classes. Contributions welcome!
